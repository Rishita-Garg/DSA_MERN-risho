# 🎉 Week 1: DSA + MERN ~ risho:)🎉

**Welcome to my Week 1 GitHub challenge!** 🚀

Hey there, curious coders! 🤓 This week marks the beginning of an exciting journey where I’m diving deep into **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** and **MERN stack development**! Each day, I’ll be solving challenging DSA problems and building cool components using **React.js**. By the end of this week, I’ll have a collection of nifty components and a better grip on arrays, strings, linked lists, and some basic algorithms! 💻

### 💡 What's Happening This Week?

I’ll be updating this repo **daily** with:

1. **DSA solutions** (solving problems on arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, and queues).
2. **MERN components** (basic UI elements that you’ll see in almost every cool web app out there!).
3. **Daily notes** where I’ll share my thoughts, what I learned, and maybe some fun coding bloopers. 😅

## 📅 Day-by-Day Breakdown

### **Day 1: Arrays & Basic MERN Setup**
- **DSA:** Started with some fun array problems! 🧮 
  - Solved problems like "Find Maximum Subarray" and learned how to optimize them.
- **MERN:** Created the skeleton of my MERN app and added a super simple **Hello World** component. Not too fancy yet, but gotta start somewhere! 🎉

---

### **Day 2: Arrays Part II & Button Component**
- **DSA:** More arrays, this time with cool tricks like sliding windows and two-pointers! 🎯
  - Implemented solutions for "Find All Duplicates" and "Merge Intervals."
- **MERN:** Built a reusable **Button** component that can handle different colors, sizes, and texts! Now you can click away in style. 😎

---

### **Day 3: Strings & Card Component**
- **DSA:** Started working with strings today. Reversing them, checking for palindromes... the usual stringy stuff! 🔄
  - Solved "Longest Common Prefix" and "Valid Palindrome."
- **MERN:** Built a **Card** component that shows a title, description, and a cute image. Feeling like a designer already! 🎨

---

### **Day 4: Linked Lists & List Component**
- **DSA:** Jumped into linked lists! Linked lists are like the cool kid of DSA, tricky but fun once you get the hang of them. 😎
  - Created and reversed a singly linked list, and checked for cycles.
- **MERN:** Created a dynamic **List** component where you can add and remove items. Perfect for those "to-do" app vibes! ✅

---

### **Day 5: Linked Lists Part II & Modal Component**
- **DSA:** Reversed a linked list and detected cycles... Phew! 🌀 
  - Solved problems like "Detect Cycle in Linked List" and "Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists."
- **MERN:** Built a fancy **Modal** component that pops up on command. 🎩 Abracadabra!

---

### **Day 6: Stacks & Navbar Component**
- **DSA:** Stacked up some problems today! Pushed and popped my way through stacks. 🔼🔽
  - Implemented a stack using both arrays and linked lists. 
- **MERN:** Built a responsive **Navbar** component with links to Home, About, and Contact. Because navigation is key! 🧭

---

### **Day 7: Queues & Accordion Component**
- **DSA:** Queued up some solutions! Circular queues, regular queues... I got them all covered. ⏳
  - Solved problems on "Queue Implementation" and "Circular Queue."
- **MERN:** Created a neat **Accordion** component that expands and collapses with a click. Perfect for FAQs! 🤓

## 🌟 What’s Coming Next Week?

Next week, I’ll continue solving more challenging problems like **trees and recursion**, and I’ll build even more awesome MERN components (think pagination, charts, and more!). Stay tuned! 🔥
